# SteppingFeet
A stepping feet illusion with a Java GUI. Done for a school project.

SteppingFeet.jar is an executable jar, meaning if you download and run it, it will show you what the end product looks like.
When you run it, it doesn't install anything on your system as it is a portable program.

Created for a final project in the Theory of Knowledge course at Berkeley High School, Berkeley, CA.
